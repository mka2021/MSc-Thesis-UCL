Abstract
Innovation is regarded as the main factor stimulating economic growth and is subsequently given a great emphasis 
from policymakers and business managers alike. However, decision making regarding innovativeness requires timely, 
firm-level granular and reliable data which is frequently not available. Conventional measures based on patenting data 
or surveys are not suitable to measure innovativeness in such a dynamic economic environment as of today.
Therefore, this paper addresses this area of research by proposing a machine learning framework for ranking 
different business entities according to their level of innovativeness. The framework uses entirely open data and is, therefore, 
establishing a fully reproducible procedure with multiple areas of application. Moreover, the proposed framework offers an alternative 
to the cost and time intensive innovation surveys by offering a methodology which is scalable, time efficient and does not require significant 
investments in neither data access nor hardware. As a mean to rank the innovativeness of a company, the framework proposes a methodology of 
generating a labelled dataset based on objective criteria. By proposing this methodology, the framework becomes relevant to numerous fields of 
application and research areas. The framework is hen used on UK companies to demonstrate its advantages by using various machine learning 
methods built on the framework.
The paper concludes with a review of the findings and further research directions to further develop the proposed framework.
